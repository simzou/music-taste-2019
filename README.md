Todo:
- [x] add equivalent tools to compile / transpile / translate html/css/js from their dev versions and achieve same result
    - [x] download production versions of html, js, css to debug differences
        - [x] replicate html build
            - use webpack handlebars plugin
        - [x] replicate css build
            - damn this was hard, needed to chain css loader, install another plugin to emit to file, add a line to import the .styl in the js
            - all that, and the missing slider problem is still there
        - [x] replicate js build
            - deleted one of the configs, had to rename the other to get it recognized
    - [x] debug disappearance of slider on local version
        - there was a display: none set on the slider wrapper WHY?
    - [ ] debug / find default player behavior
- [ ] Excise gulp from this project, move it all to webpack (gulp doesn't play nice with new versions of npm, too lazy to troubleshoot)
- [ ] update data
    - [ ] get spotify api auth
    - [ ] scrape (or via api if it exists) billboard top 5
    - [ ] determine schema / id system and insert new rows into csv
    - [ ] move into sqlite db maybe (stretch goal)
